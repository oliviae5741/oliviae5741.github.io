A contract is the layout, plan, and blueprint of a funtion. The function is made with a domain, range, and name. The name of a contract tells you what the contract does. For example if i was looking for a funtion to tell me the legnth  of the hypotnuse of a right triangle, the name could be h-lenght. It tells you what we are looking for. The legnth of a hypotnuse. The second part is the domain. That is the point were, we are trying to see that the funtion exprects. In this situation what would be two numbes because of the other legs. Finally the ranage, this part tells you what the funtion produces. In this case that would be a number, because we are asking it to produce a number which is the legnth of a hypotnuse. In all it would look like,:
h-length(leg1::Number,leg2::Number)-> Number. That is what a contract would look like. The way that it is writte, with uppercase and lower case letters is because the language reads upercase letters as data types. This is what makes a funtion
