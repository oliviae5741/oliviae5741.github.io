 This week we took a midterm this week and it was on all of the things we've learned this year. One of the questions were
      6.Which funtion application matches the contract below?
                       \# message-cost :: Number-> Number
                      
      (a) message-cost(16)
      (b) message-cost(where are you)
      (c) message-cost(25,15)
      (d)message-cost("lemon","lime")
      
There are many components to this question, so I am going to break it down. A contract is like a plan, for a pice of code. It tells the user what to expect in it. In this code the user is useing a code named message cost, this expects a number as its code. It produces a number. 

Now by looking at the answers, right off the bat you see anser a has a name message cost, and the number 16. It looks correct but let keep going.
