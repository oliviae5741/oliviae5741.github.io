## Flag of _insert your country_ by _insert your name_

## Describe your program

-   What country did you design for? _then delete this instruction_
-   What grade do you expect? _then delete this instruction_

I worked on the flag or tunisa, and I am expecting a 4 because I finished the flag and I will be able to eplain my code.


## Current output

-   Insert an image that your program currently produces. _then delete this instruction_

## Describe your process.

-   What questions, strategies, help from peers or teacher, or thinking got you to this point? _then delete this instruction_

## Explain your code.

-   Choose a significant part of your program (15 lines max) and paste it below. Do not insert your entire program here. _then delete this instruction_
-   Explain each argument in the code section. _then delete this instruction_
-   Tell us how it functions independently and within the whole program _then delete this instruction_




All code is important, howeverinclude image

size = 100

width = size * 3
height = size * 2

base = rectangle(width, height, "solid", "red")

circle-r = height / 4

h-h = height / 2
h-w = width / 2

wc = circle(circle-r,"solid","white")
Wc = place-image(wc, h-w, h-h, base)

rc = circle(circle-r * 0.75, "solid", "red")
RC = place-image(rc, h-w, h-h, Wc)

wcc = circle(circle-r * 0.6, "solid", "white") 
WCC= place-image(wcc, h-w * 1.07, h-h, RC)

s= star(circle-r * 0.55, "solid", "red")
ss= place-image(rotate(20,s), h-w * 1.07, h-h, WCC)
 in this code there are certain parts that really stand out and help form my flag. This part goes and places all the spaces onto each other. This part uses the previous shape and places it onto the other shape, using the propotions to balence out my code. The place-image code used the already esablished code, and places on image over an other image. This code is very important. Without it I would have had a difficult time being able to place all the code on top of each other. You need ot be able to scale the image to any size, and after multiple tries with mulitple diffent types of code, place image worked the best and fastes with little to know error.

```
wc = circle(circle-r,"solid","white")
Wc = place-image(wc, h-w, h-h, base)

rc = circle(circle-r * 0.75, "solid", "red")
RC = place-image(rc, h-w, h-h, Wc)

wcc = circle(circle-r * 0.6, "solid", "white") 
WCC= place-image(wcc, h-w * 1.07, h-h, RC)

s= star(circle-r * 0.55, "solid", "red")
ss= place-image(rotate(20,s), h-w * 1.07, h-h, WCC)

```

* * *Insert 10-15 line code section here _then delete this instruction_

-   Explain the code you posted by telling us about each argument.
-   Then tell us how your code section fits into the whole.

## Program code

```
include image

size = 100

width = size * 3
height = size * 2

base = rectangle(width, height, "solid", "red")

circle-r = height / 4

h-h = height / 2
h-w = width / 2

wc = circle(circle-r,"solid","white")
Wc = place-image(wc, h-w, h-h, base)

rc = circle(circle-r * 0.75, "solid", "red")
RC = place-image(rc, h-w, h-h, Wc)

wcc = circle(circle-r * 0.6, "solid", "white") 
WCC= place-image(wcc, h-w * 1.07, h-h, RC)

s= star(circle-r * 0.55, "solid", "red")
ss= place-image(rotate(20,s), h-w * 1.07, h-h, WCC)

```
