For the past few weeks we have been learning about data tables and data abstractions 
<u>
  DATA TABLES
</u>
A data table consists of many componants. It has a header that has all the names of the feilds AKA the name of the columb.
They have one of two types of data, Catigorical data, which is data that looks at catagories. The other type is Quantitative data. This type of data is adding or subtracting. The data tables we have looked at take in 3 types of data, Numbers, Strings,and Booleans. a table has actual data in it. It goes and shows a chard. If you play a video game would it be fin if you know what is gonna happen, no. Something needes to happen. A video game is like a table when its done. It shows all the data. 
  

<u>
  DATA ABSTACTIONS 
  
Abstractions what it could have. An abstation is like the video could be without playing it. It means that you are in a way hinding the deatails of a graph.
